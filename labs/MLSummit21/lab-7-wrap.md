# Lab 7 - Summary and Wrap Up

## Summary

In this workshop, we have gone through the simple steps of building and deploying a machine learning model in OCI Data Science including:

* Create a notebook session in OCI Data Science
* Install a Conda Environment
* Build a Machine Learning Model
* Explore the features of Model Catalog
* Deploy the model
* Deactivate resources

The purpose of this workshop was to give you an overview of the OCI Data Science service without going into the details and more advanced scenarios. Although the workshop simulates and end-to-end story, typical machine learning use cases are more complex. We have a series of additional resources and tutorials that cover some of these more advanced use cases. Try them out in your OCI tenancy:

* [Create your own conda environment from scratch](https://blogs.oracle.com/ai-and-datascience/post/creating-a-new-conda-environment-from-scratch-in-oci-data-science)

* [Setting up Logging for Model Deployment](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/model_dep_create.htm)

* [Tutorials on using OCI Data Science Jobs](https://github.com/oracle/oci-data-science-ai-samples/tree/master/jobs)

* [Calling OCI Data Flow from Data Science](https://github.com/oracle/oci-data-science-ai-samples/blob/master/conda_environment_notebooks/pyspark/dataflow.ipynb)

* ADS Library is now available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/oracle-ads/). Try it on your laptop!
